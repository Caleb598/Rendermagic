# Overview
An ongoing challenge in the animation industry is the process of rendering movies. One frame of an animated movie takes about 24 hours to render. So, to fix the issue, development and research was made to make a software that could fastly render complex animations. So, enter Rendermagic. Rendermagic is a super fast and powerful 3D rendering software that can make high-quality, photorealistic images and animations. It was created using the Python coding language. Rendermagic is highly technical, as it does not come with an user interface. This was likely due to some issues with implementing an interface that could handle all the features I possibly wanted it to handle. Despite that, you can still do amazing things with it by writing code and programming it to render scenes. Rendermagic is specifically designed to be used by experts in the industry, but also for beginners. Rendermagic also comes with a tutorial for beginners and for users who are just trying it out for the first time. 

# Pros and Cons
Pros: Fast and versatile

Cons: Highly Technical and limited capability of doing more advanced rendering

# Acclaim for Rendermagic
It won third place in the VPRSF Science Fair on March 23, 2024. It was in the Computer Science category. 

# Additional Things and Troubles
You will need to create a folder called "frames" in order for the code to work. This will store frames of animation into the folder. After running the code, you can get a video by assessing your Videos section and it should be named "animation.mp4".
